---INTRODUCTION---

Hey everyone my name is Blayst and I’m a huge fan of ret in TBC. I've played on endless, feenix and other servers in between with a ret paladin.
You may be coming fresh off of classic and be thinking of ret as a very bad meme spec, but that is not how it is in TBC. In the right hands, ret can be a competitive overall raid dps, and the best melee dps on a lot of fights. 
Ret brings a third blessing to the group, which brings a lot of balance to a raid. They provide their party with a 2% damage increase through improved sanctity aura. They increase the critical strike chance of all melee, ranged, and spell attacks on the target through Improved Seal of the Crusader (while also increasing the holy damage taken by the target for the ret and prot pally). Finally, they are key to a pumper hunter party by keeping up JoW through the use of crusader strike. 
Ret is essential for a hardcore raid and one of the most interactive dps classes to play in tbc. Between large burst numbers, seal twisting, ranking consecrate and the ability to dispel, ret offers the raid some utility while also being a very fun priority rotation based class.

What I'm going to be talking about is some basic guidelines as well as some more minmaxing subjects pertaining to pve ret throughout all of the tiers of raiding. If you like the information in this document or have any questions or disagree and would like to discuss, come on over to the TBC paladin discord (Light Club) or pop in my twitch chat. The links are below.

With that said, let's get into it.


---STATS---

Strength: Strength is the bread and butter of the attack power side of a ret paladin. 1 Strength is equal to 2.42 attack power in the raid setting.  (Str gives 2 AP baseline, +10% from kings\+10% from Divine Strength) Stacking strength is great for your gems, however when it comes to gear, you need to make sure you are hit capped, and get expertise where you can.

Agility/Crit: I put these two together because I wanted to compare them as they bring the same thing to the table. In a raid setting: Agility gives 1.1% crit for every 25 agility you gain. The reason I use 25 Agility is because, without kings, 25 agility gives 1% crit. As for crit rating, a little over 22 crit rating gives 1% crit. As you can see, even with kings, crit rating gives a little more bang for its buck for crit chance. This doesn't mean that you should avoid agility at all costs. A lot of our bis pieces are agi leather pieces for that respective tier. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hit and Expertise: These are huge stats for a two-hand dps. It affects the ability for our white hits, Crusader strike, Seals and WF to land on the target. We will start with Hit. 

Hit: The hit cap in TBC for ret paladin is 9%. However, ret paladins spec into 3% hit in the protection tree, which now makes our hit cap 6%. On top of that, most guilds will run a boomkin in their raid composition. This gives the melee and hunters an extra 3% hit when the boomkin keeps Faerie Fire up on the target. Now a top guild min maxing ret paladin will have two hit sets. One that brings them to the 6% cap, and one to the 3% cap. This will allow the ret to have more itemization in other dps increasing stats. One of the biggest dps losses that a ret can do is get wildly over the hit cap. If you find yourself at 9%+ hit in just raw gear totals, you should find out some gear swaps to increase your damage elsewhere.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Expertise: Before we talk about expertise, I need to stress the importance of standing behind the target that you are attacking. This eliminates the mobs ability to parry your attacks. Parry adds yet another mechanic that will reduce our dps by missing the target, BUT ALSO will cause the mob to be parry hasted, attacking the tank target faster. This can be very bad in a high damage encounter. 

Expertise is one of the most talked about stats for melee in TBC. Expertise is very similar to Hit, but much harder to obtain. Every boss in the game has a 6.5% dodge chance on all of your melee attacks (which includes your seals). You need 26 Expertise to be fully dodge capped. Expertise for ret is EXTREMELY important. It is one of the biggest dps increasing stats that you can come by. There are a couple pieces that I would recommend getting:::

Shattrath Leggings/Clefthoof Hide Leggings: You should be wearing one of these legs until t5 (if human, t6 if not) . If you are low on hit and need a bit more, Clefthoof Hide Leggings would take precedence. However, if you do not need the hit I would recommend using Shattrath leggings. One thing we also need to remember is that Clefthoof Hide Leggings is a kilt or a dress. So for anyone that is worried about the aesthetics of their character, that is something to take into account. 

Shapeshifter's Signet: Lower City is a rep that you should push to exalted fairly quickly. The exalted ring is a great source of expertise and also offers 1.1% crit. I use this ring all throughout T6. 

Flesh handler’s Gauntlets/Grips of Deftness/Gloves of the Searing Grip: Great and easy piece to obtain for pre-raid bis, t4 drops off of trash in karazhan, and an upgraded version is available and is the t5 bis piece for ret off of al'ar. 

Shoulderpads of the Stranger: These shoulders drop off of Hydross and will be your BIS until Sunwell. If you have the opportunity to pick these up, GET THEM. 

Belt of One-Hundred Deaths: This belt is every melees wet dream. It gives such an insane dps boost. This belt is bis until t6 belt in Sunwell. 

These last two pieces will be the best expertise pieces that you can get pre-sunwell. If you are serious about ret DPS I would make a point to get them.

When it comes to sunwell pieces, we have a couple of choices. 

Shard of Contempt: Amazing melee trinket that all melees will go after, this should be something you rush ASAP. It will be one of the biggest dps increasing items that you can obtain. This trinket is BIS in game paired with Blackened Naaru Sliver. 

T6 Belt/Bracers/Boots: All of these pieces have insane stats for ret. Crit, haste, Expertise. You can't get better than that. All of these pieces should be picked up when possible. 

It is important to note that with the T6 Belt/Bracers/Boots combo and Shard of Contempt that you are at expertise cap (non-human). Any other pieces that give expertise at this point would not yield a dps increase.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Armor Penetration and Haste are stats that are fairly irrelevant till t6, and are some of the more powerful secondary stats. Let's start with armor pen and the basics.

Armor Penetration: Armor Penetration, ignores the armor of the boss. We need to understand how armor works before we can continue. Armor as a stat provides diminishing returns, meaning that as you stack more armor, it will give you less physical damage reduction per point of armor. That means that when you ignore the first 1000 armor of a boss it is NOT the same dps increase as ignoring the LAST 1000 armor on a boss. Bosses in TBC have 3 different armor values. Bosses with 6200 armor, 7700 armor, and one lone boss with 8800 armor, which you should not be attempting to gear armor penetration for. Most bosses have 7700 armor. In order to figure out if armor pen gear is really worth it for you, you need to figure out if your raid comp is utilizing the correct debuffs:::

Improved Expose Armor: Gives 3075 armor penetration. Get a rogue that keeps this up 100% of the time and your raids dps will be insane. 
Improved Faerie Fire: Gives 3% hit but also gives 610 penetration.
Curse Recklessness: Gives 800 Armor penetration.
Annihilators: These are level 58 axes that give 200 armor pen stacking up to 3 times, up to 600 armor pen. This 600 armor pen is some of the last bit of armor pen some classes need for an easy 6200 cap. They are also great for 7700 armor bosses. These will most likely not see play. 

All of these together (minus Annihilators) reduce the target's armor by 4,485. Leaving only 1715 Armor left to gear for a 6200 armor boss cap, and 3215 armor to ignore on 7700 armor bosses.


It's worth noting that Armor penetration is only increasing around 55-70% of your overall damage, because seal damage does not get increased by armor penetration. This does not make armor penetration completely useless for the ret paladin, but it does make haste better for the seal twisting paladin until reaching SWP gear levels.

If you want more in-depth math for ARP damage increases, refer to this ARP calculator that a big brain friend drafted up. Keep in mind this is for 100% physical damage and if you are using this for ret, you should only use 55-70% of the arp boost. (Credit to Phillip)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Haste: Haste is a stat that Seal of Blood paladins absolutely love. Here is the chart of haste increases with SoB and SoC.


As you can see haste is slightly better for the SoB paladin. Haste is the best stat for a twisting ret up until the paladin cannot apply SoC and reapply SoB before the auto-attack. (1.6 second attack speed) This speed is virtually unobtainable, 1.6 is just for you to understand that you can break the 3.0 swing speed. 

It's also important to note that more haste will reduce the time that your judgement and crusader strike will be sitting off cooldown. This is through your weapon speed being quicker and being able to judge or CS after landing an auto-attack.

I have seen people saying that haste has 0 effect on SoC, which is incorrect. Haste increases the amount of procs of SoC through hastened PPM mechanics:::

60 / Base Weapon Speed = Attacks Per Minute
PPM / Attacks Per Minute = Proc Chance 
Base Weapon Speed / (Haste) = Attack Speed 
60 / Attack Speed = Hastened Attacks Per Minute 
Hastened Attacks Per Minute * Proc Chance = New PPM 
Total Number of Instants Per Minute + Hastened Attacks Per Minute * Proc Chance = Actual PPM 

PPM scales to PPH according to weapon speed (Proc Per Minute; Proc Per Hit)
PPH = (Weapon speed) / (60 / PPM)
Which is the same as: PPH = Weapon speed * PPM / 60 
This gives the percentage chance that the proc will be triggered each hit. Note that PPM is an average, not a guarantee.

PPM & Haste: The speed used for calculating the PPH ( Proc per Hit ) chance is the basic weapon speed, not the character's haste-affected hit speed. This means the probability of a proc is not lowered or increased by haste. What haste does is increase the total amount of melee hits in a hasted window of time, thus increasing the total amount of procs in a minute. 
SoC has a base of 7ppm. So based upon your weapon speed and the amount of speed increasing effects on your paladin, your actual PPM can increase.

Information on PPM taken from wowwiki: https://wowwiki-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Procs_per_minute#:~:text=PPM%20and%20Haste&text=This%20means%20the%20probability%20of,the%20total%20amount%20of%20procs.


STAT SUMMARY 
Get 2 hit sets 3% and 6% -> Get Expertise where you can -> Haste until twisting is impossible (outside of BL/Hero) > Armor pen

---TALENTS---

I will be talking about two talent spec choices, both with a one talent point difference. First I’d like to talk about some key ret talents and why they’re great:::

Improved Seal of the Crusader: This talent is incredible for the raid. Giving everyone an additional 3% crit on the target. This talent is one of the reasons why a ret spot is needed in raids. 
Seal of Command: Even though we are using Seal of Blood as our main dps seal, Seal of Command will be used to seal twist. Which is giving the ret the ability to land an auto-attack and proc both SoC and SoB. Seal of Command is also a great spell for prince in Kara (Blood tends to kill you). 
Vengeance: Vengeance is the holy grail talent of doing a ton of damage as ret. Giving us up to 15% increased damage from our weapon swings, holy spells and abilities. It's important to spec into this and also important to stack it quickly in a fight and maintain the buff. 
Crusader Strike: This ability is key for keeping up the appropriate judgements on the target. Get hit capped and as much expertise as you can. So your hunters don't yell at you when JoW falls off. 
Precision: Key talent that helps itemization of your character and also leads to Blessing of Kings. This brings your hit cap down to 6% without a boomkin in the raid. 
Blessing of Kings: Kings offers the raid the ability to buff everyone with the correct blessing. Prot Paladins will be taking sanc/salv, while Holy Paladins will be in charge of Wisdom/Might (because they spec both into improved). There may be a chance that you yourself will not have to spec into this. (Which I don’t recommend) Consult your raid and raid leader before doing so. 

These are some of the key talents that a ret paladin should be aware of and bring to the raid.


As for the specs we are going to start with the mana efficient one:::

The first is the standard spec that I would recommend running. The talents in question are Pursuit of Justice and Sanctified Judgement. In this spec I am using 2/3 Pursuit of Justice and 3/3 Sanctified Judgement. This is the more mana efficient build. If you aren't moving around a lot for bosses, or you find yourself needing mana, this is the spec for you. This will be the spec that I will be running for a majority of the expansion, it allows me to continuously seal twist as well as use a rank 4 or 6 consecration throughout the fight. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The second spec is switching the two talents, giving Pursuit of Justice 3/3 and Sanctified Judgement 2/3. So here is the opposite of the other spec, if you find yourself constantly capping mana, even with seal twisting and spamming max rank consecrate, which can happen, this spec might be for you. It is also increasing your movement speed by 5% getting you to dps faster or move out of mechanics. This spec is great in t5 with heavy movement.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Overall, I would recommend the first spec as the best and most useful all around pve ret spec. If your guild has quick kill times, I recommend the second. 


---PROFESSIONS---

Here I am going to be talking about the best professions for PVE ret and how to swap them throughout the tiers to minmax your damage. If you are not concerned with min maxing your ret to its fullest extent, then the two professions that I would recommend that you hold throughout the whole expansion are Blacksmithing and Engineering. However, I know a lot of people reading this want to be top melee and beat the hunters sometimes.


Blacksmithing: The best profession for beginning the expansion. It gives you access to incredible weapons that are better than any drops in phase 1. 

Lionheart Champion/Executioner:  This will be your BIS weapon for Phase 1 / Phase 2. You need to be aiming to craft this ASAP. It looks badass with mongoose and the proc is bonkers for ret. Lionheart has a 1ppm with ONLY auto-attacking, which is increased in a full dps rotation, and a 6% chance to proc on all abilities that can proc it; this includes: Auto-Attack, Windfury, Crusader Strike, Seal of Command, and Judgements. 

Deep Thunder/Stormherald: I put these in here just to compare. If you care mostly about maximizing your pve ret dps then go with the sword and don't look back. But if any part of you wants to pvp seriously, stun people in arena or out in the world, then I would go for the mace. Again this is ONLY IF YOU PLAN ON PVPING SERIOUSLY. 

In order to craft and equip these weapons you will need to finish the weaponsmithing quest. Then you can choose between sword or mace specialization. 
It is possible for you to drop your current specialization (100g) and learn the other specialization, without having to relevel blacksmithing. This means that it is possible to craft and use both of these weapons. 

Engineering: Blayst’s Recommendation for maximum fun
I am giving engineering my recommendation because it is so much fun with ret. You can use engineering in any tier of raiding because of the utility and the interaction with sapper charges. 
Sapper charges: Sapper charges are a fun consumable to use. We have access to both Super Sapper Charges and Goblin Sapper Charges. They can be rotated between each other. Each sapper has a 5 minute individual cooldown. But using one will place the other on a 2 minute cooldown. The cool thing about sappers is that they get increased by your avenging wrath, and a mage's scorch stacks on a target, causing it to do insane amounts of damage. The highest I have had my super sapper crit was 5k, so if you want to see huge burst potential and ACTUAL aoe dps ret paladin then engineering could be for you. Sapper charges share a unique cooldown with drums. It will place the drums on a 1 minute cooldown. If you use drums before the sappers however, they will be placed on a 2 minute cooldown.
Engi Helm: This helm will be released during phase 2 (Tier 5) and will be the BIS helm until Illidari Council or Illidan Helm. 
Bombs: You also have access to a couple other bombs that are great for big aoe packs when your sapper is on cooldown or you want to save them for another occasion. The Bigger One and Fel Iron Bombs can be used for aoe depending on how spicy you are trying to be. They're great for solarian and tidewalker in t5. Arcane bombs are also another bomb that you have access to, these are used for utility. If your raid is struggling with caster mob packs, you can use these to silence them for some damage relief. These are especially helpful in Hyjal and BT. 
Chicken: GNOMISH BATTLE CHICKEN. You equip this trinket and coordinate with your raid prior to pulling your boss fight. You summon the chicken and then swap back to your regular trinket, the chicken will stay for its 1.5 min. During that time, if your chicken enrages it will SQUAWK, giving your party a 5% attack speed buff for 4 minutes. This can be incredibly helpful for your party if you are going to choose engineering. THIS BUFF CAN STACK 5 TIMES UP TO 25% ATTACK SPEED FOR YOUR PARTY. 

Now that we have covered the basic professions that every ret paladin should start out with, we will move into the later tiers of raiding and how to minmax your professions.


T6: 
I would recommend dropping Blacksmithing for one of these three professions: 

JC/Enchanting/LW


Jewelcrafting: One of the final professions a ret should have. Hard Khorium Choker is great and is only craftable and equippable by a JC. Keep in mind that you are not able to enchant your rings unless you are an enchanter, so the 8 stats + the SSO neck/brutallus neck could pull ahead of the JC neck for a twisting paladin.

Enchanting: Fairly straightforward profession, you will be climbing to 375 enchanting for the 4 stats ring enchants. Always go for the stats, don't for the weapon damage enchant. It will be the highest dps increasing ring enchant that you can get in game. Keep in mind that 4 stats to ring will not be in the game until phase 3. You are not able to pick up enchanting and drop it and keep the ring enchants. You are required to be enchanting in order to take advantage of the stat bonuses. 

*Honorable Mention*
Leatherworking: Leatherworking is the best pve profession in TBC for the raids damage hands down. It will increase the RAIDS damage the most out of any profession, which top guilds will want to bring one per group.
You get access to a couple consumables that are called Drums. 

Drums of Battle: This will be the main drum that you will be using, it is the highest raw damage increase for the party. Top Guilds will have one per party, and will be paired with BL/Hero. 
Drums of War: This drum does not increase the raid's damage as much as Battle, but is good for gaining threat on a prot paladin.
Drums of Restoration: I'm only mentioning this drum simply because I hate Khaz'rogal, If you find yourself so incredibly oom and dying extremely fast in that fight, I would recommend keeping one in your bags. 
Drums of Speed: With the speed run meta being alive and well in TBC. It's a possibility that raids will use these to get through the raids faster, these aren't required drums in my opinion, but they are nice to have on you. 

So in the end of the expansion with SWP you should have Engineering and Enchanting, Jewelcrafting, or Leatherworking to maximize both you and your party's damage.


Blayst’s profession route: BS/Engi > Drop BS for Enchanting


---ROTATION/SEAL TWISTING---

In order to dps at a high level on a ret paladin in TBC you will need to understand what seal twisting is. Seal twisting in TBC is a tactic that ret paladins use to maximize their dps by proccing two seals on one melee attack. The most common form for ret is SoC and SoB. In order to do this, you must wait for your melee swing, and .4 to .1 seconds before your attack lands you will swap between seals (Seal of Command into Seal of Blood). This gives the ret paladin the ability to land a white melee hit during that time, and proc both seals on one swing. This is a dps increase that will take time to master, and based on your ping it can be simple or difficult. 

In order to effectively twist the paladin needs to make sure that they're utilizing a swing timer add-on of some sort. This will allow the paladin to see when their melee hits are about to land. Seal twisting also becomes more difficult in gear with higher amounts of haste as well as haste effects.

You should be using Rank 1 Seal of Command only. There is no reason to apply max rank Seal of Command in pve. You will also never be judging Seal of Command, the only Seal that you will be judging is Seal of Blood/Seal of the Crusader. 


Rotation: Including Seal Twisting

Here is a graphic courtesy of Terryn showing the basic rotation. This implies that Improved Judgement of Crusader is already applied to the target.



This graphic assumes that you are keeping at a 3.0 swing timer. I would also like to point out that applying Improved Judgement of the Crusader outside of melee range, then using a stop attack macro. Followed by the startattack macro (located in the macros section) to twist SoC>SoB on your opening is the appropriate way to start your rotation. This gives you a chance to twist in the beginning, followed by a crusader strike. 

As you can see in the graphic, there are points in the rotation where both your judgement and Crusader strike will be on cooldown, and you will have Seal of Blood applied and just land an auto attack. During that time, it is a dps increase to swap to Seal of Command in order to get ready to twist on your next Auto-Attack. 

Make sure to watch the judgements that you are refreshing on the current target. If you miss/dodge a CS or it is close to expiring, consider prioritizing CS over everything. Keep up the judgements or feel the wrath of the hunters and raid lead.


Priority based rotation

While the graphic above is great in helping visualize what the basic rotation would look like; the rotation that a ret paladin will follow in tbc is more of a priority based rotation that is determined by your current swing speed. You should aim to follow these priorities while dpsing: 

1. Make sure Improved Judgement of the Crusader is on the target.
2. Twist SoC into SoB on auto-attack (swap back to SoC if in SoB prior to auto-attack)
3. Crusader Strike on cooldown (Can be delayed up to 2 seconds for Twist).
4. Judgement of Blood.
5. Exorcism if the target is Undead or Demon.
6. Consecrate depending on your current and future mana pool (Ranks 4, 6). If there are multiple targets, consider using this over Exorcism. 

Spell haste will reduce the GCD of your seals and spells, if you are able to apply two seals inside your current swing speed, twisting during BL/Hero will result in a dps increase.

Bloodlust/Heroism rotation

During Bloodlust/Heroism, you can obtain what is called a ⅔ rotation (Twist/Twist/CS) During a BL/Hero + Haste pot you will be able to twist on an auto attack, twist on the next, and crusader strike on the third. You will then repeat this rotation. This can also be obtained with bloodlust + Trinket proc (DST or Abacus). If you have BL/Hero + Haste potion + Trinket proc at the same time. You will be attacking too fast to obtain a ⅔ rotation. Battle chickens and stacking them can also affect this rotation. With one squawk, you are able to continue this rotation, anything more and it becomes too fast. With more than one chicken you can obtain a ⅔ rotation (CS/Twist/Auto/Twist). That is with stacking a haste trinket effect + haste potion inside of bloodlust. 

When to judge

You can judge in two locations during the actual dps rotation. 
You have just auto attacked while blood is up, and you are planning to twist on the next auto attack. You can judge for damage, while also being able to apply Seal of Command freely. 
Your judgement is off of cooldown and you are about to land an auto attack with blood. You can judge, and reapply blood prior to that auto attack. This gives you the libram crit buff for both that auto attack, and the subsequent twist. 

HAMMER OF WRATH IS NOT A DPS INCREASE IN MELEE RANGE. Hammer of wrath resets your swing timer for very minimal damage compared to letting the twisting ride. You should only use HoW in 2 situations:
The target is far away and you cannot dps the target by melee means. 
The target is SUB 1% and JUST about to die, your CS/Judge is on CD and you are not about to land a melee attack.


Here is a link to Blayst’s Seal Twisting & Rotation Guide: https://youtu.be/PIjJ2pcnLVQ
Here is a link to the weakaura that I use for seal twisting. It has a Swing timer, Seal indicator, and buff indicators all in one: https://wago.io/Sw_l1YeZg 
Here is a link to Beetis Golden Ratio Twist WA. This shows what % of attacks during an encounter you have attempted twisting. https://wago.io/R_VcH3fO8 


Cooldowns

There are a couple cooldowns that ret can utilize in order to maximize their damage. Let's talk about them before we talk about how to use them. 

Avenging Wrath: AW increases all damage caused by 30% for 20 seconds. This is a cooldown that Ret should be using almost every time that it is up. The best way to use this cooldown is with a couple guidelines.

Use AW after you have 3 stacks of Vengeance. 
It’s best to time the use of AW when you have Crusader strike off CD, and you are about to land a melee hit with a twist. This maximizes the amount of hits that you can land during the duration. 
Make sure that BL/Hero/Drums of Battle are up prior to popping AW.
Time your DPS Potion with AW, It is best to use a macro. 
If you have any on use trinkets, it is also best to put those in the macro as well. There are a couple effect trinkets that I want to talk about briefly with AW. 
Dragonspine Trophy: One of the most insane trinkets in the game for melee. It drops in t4 and lasts until late t6. Will be difficult to time with AW but can result in some insane speeds.Watch this trinket proc closely during BL/Hero.
Darkmoon Card: Crusade: This trinket effect stacks up to 20 times up to an extra 120 Attack Power, as well as 10 times for 80 spell damage. If you can wait to have this stacked up all the way before you use AW then I would do so; however, do not wait and lose the effects of bloodlust/heroism.
Any other effect trinket: It is best to try and use them all together; however, that does not mean that you should sit on AW for a long time. Depending on the length and the flow of the fight SOMETIMES IT'S NOT WORTH WAITING FOR THE TRINKET EFFECTS TO PROC. 
If you are an Engineer, make sure that you use Super Sapper Charge during the effects of AW, since they scale off of its increased damage. You will see an increase in dps; however, sometimes it is better to hold the sapper for AoE situations, use accordingly. 

You can use the add-on “Procodile” to track your trinket cooldowns and uptimes. 


Haste Potion: Haste Potion increases your haste rating by 400 for 15 seconds. This should be in a macro with AW. Since it has a 2 minute cooldown, you should attempt to pair the second Haste Potion you use in a fight with a trinket proc or drums.
Drums of Battle: Drums of Battle increases the party's haste rating by 80 for 30 seconds. Try to time this with AW.
Trinkets: Make sure that your on-use trinkets are in your macros for AW/Haste Potion/On-Use Trinket. If it is an effect trinket, try to time your cooldowns to match it. 


All of your Cooldowns will do increased damage if you use them during the effects of Bloodlust/Heroism. Since BL/Hero is a 40 second duration, it's best to make sure you have that before using any other cooldowns to maximize your damage. 


---REPUTATIONS---

Aldor or Scryer?
When choosing Aldor or Scryer for any class I play I like to look at two things: 
The Shoulder Enchant and the Shattered Sun Offensive Exalted Neck

Shoulder Enchant: Between the shoulder enchants the Aldor outperforms the Scryer enchant in the long run. Early in gearing when you are below the crit threshold Scryer enchant outperforms but as you outgrow that quickly you should choose aldor in that regard. 
Shattered Sun Offensive Exalted Neck: Shattered Sun Pendant of Might for Aldor gives you a 200 Attack Power bonus for 10 seconds; whereas, for Scryer it gives your melee attacks a chance to proc an arcane strike for around 350 damage. This proc can crit but can also be resisted. The Aldor outperforms the Scryer portion yet again. I personally believe that this neck is BIS in game for a twisting ret.

Overall a ret paladin who is trying to push the limits on their damage should choose Aldor. 

*Notable Dungeon Reputations*
Lower City: LC gives us two notable items that we will need throughout the expansion. The Glyph of the Outcast and Shapeshifter’s Signet which you will be using throughout T6.
Sha’tar: The Sha'tar gives A’dal’s Command which is great to pair with until T5 with Shapeshifter’s Signet.
Cenarion Expedition: CE gives Glyph of Ferocity, which is another helm enchant the ret may need.


---ENCHANTS---

Helm-Glyph of Ferocity or Glyph of the Outcast
Depending on your current hit cap choose accordingly. If you are at or over hit cap then Outcast is the way to go as it provides more attack power than ferocity. If you need hit, choose Ferocity, when you are below the hit cap, Ferocity outperforms Outcast.
Shoulders-Greater Inscription of Vengeance (Aldor) or Greater Inscription of the Blade (Scryer)
If you have the opportunity to get Might of the Scourge GET IT. 
Cloak-Greater Agility
Chest-Exceptional Stats
Bracers-Brawn
Gloves-Major Strength
Legs-Nethercobra Leg armor (cobrahide if poor)
Boots-Dexterity
Rings-Stats 
Weapon-Mongoose


---GEMS---

Meta Gem: Relentless Earthstorm Diamond is your bis meta gem.

Thundering Skyfire Diamond is NOT better in any scenario. The bonus crit and increased critical strike damage will be better damage.

Red Socket: Bold Crimson Spinel (Bold Living Ruby) or Inscribed Pyrestone (Inscribed Noble Topaz)

Yellow Socket: Inscribed Pyrestone (Inscribed Noble Topaz)

Blue Socket: Sovereign Shadowsong Amethyst (Sovereign Nightseye)

You should only be using two blues gems in order to activate the Relentless Earthstorm Diamond, anything else is a complete DPS loss. You should prioritize putting them into blue sockets first, if that is not possible, red or yellow sockets will do fine. You should be avoiding blue gems with Swift Skyfire Diamond.

It’s important to note that while I have said what the best gems for each socket are, that doesn’t mean that you should gem for every single socket bonus. Sometimes a piece of gear is not worth following the sockets for. For instance, if a socket bonus gives hit, and it is a red and a yellow socket, and you are ABOVE the hit cap I would recommend gemming straight strength in both the sockets because you do not need the hit from the socket bonus.

This is also important if you have more than two blue sockets in your gear setup, only two should be socketed accordingly, go for the pieces that give the most benefit for socketing blue gems. 


*Early Heroic Gems*

In the beginning of the expansion when rare quality gems are the best jewelcrafting has to offer, some heroic gems are great.

Enscribed Fire Opal (5 str + 4 crit) Red/Yellow Gem
Heroic Mana Tombs

Sundered Chrysoprase (5 crit + 2mp5) Yellow/Blue Gem
Heroic Steamvaults

Etched Fire Opal (5 str + 4 hit) Red/Yellow Gem
Heroic Shadow Labyrinth 

Sovereign Tanzanite (5 str + 6 stam) Red/Blue Gem
Heroic Shattered Halls


---CONSUMABLES---

Flasks:::
Flask of Relentless Assault: Standard flask, should be used in all raid aspects except on demon bosses. 
Elixir of Demonslaying: This is the battle elixir you run if you are fighting a demon boss, it is only a 5 minute duration so you need to make sure that it stays up the entire fight. 
Elixir of Major Mageblood: This is the guardian elixir you run if you are fighting a demon boss, this is a 1 hour duration so you don't need to baby it like you do demonslaying. 

Food:::
Roasted Clefthoof: 20 Strength Great food, gives 48~ attack power in raid. 

Potions:::
Haste Potion: This is the potion you will be using for a SoB paladin. Try to make sure to stagger this with your haste trinket procs during BL/Hero. But that doesn’t mean to hold your haste pot for 10+ seconds, use your haste pot on CD or close to it. 
Super Mana Potion: This Potion is not used for dps but used for utility. I use these during trash when trying to keep up and keep my mana up. It also allows me to hit higher rank consecrates during Hyjal trash. 

Drums:::
Drums of Battle: Make sure that someone in your party is a LW in order to benefit from the drums buff.

Scrolls::
Agility V/Strength V: They give 20 of each stat respectively, if you are trying to minmax as ret, you need to make sure you are buffed with these prior to every boss. Strength gives another 48~ attack power and Agility gives around .88% crit. 

*DARK RUNE*
Dark Runes or Demonic Runes: Consumable that you will be chugging as a minmaxing ret paladin. If you are constantly seal twisting, crusader strike on cooldown, using ranks 4-6 consecrates, and exorcism, your mana will drain fast. The great thing about runes is that it returns mana to you, as well as dealing damage to yourself, this can be healed and used as mana regen through Spiritual Attunement. If you do not use Dark runes you will not be able to pump at high and longer increments compared to other classes. Dark runes are non-negotiable for the pumper ret. You can also use demonic runes if you farm them. They are BoP though. Runes also share a cooldown with Healthstone.

---MACROS---

Crusader Strike start attack macro. This macro is used in order to ensure that you are attacking the target. It is also helpful for restarting your swing after a fear. 

/startattack
/cast Crusader Strike

AW Pop everything dps cooldown. This macro is used for popping Avenging Wrath, Haste Potion (or Insane Strength), while also using an on-use trinket. 

#showtooltip Avenging Wrath
/use Haste Potion
/use *trinket name*
/cast Avenging Wrath

Mouseover BoP macro. Quick macro that is used for BoPing a mouseover target instead of having to click the target prior. This macro can also be used for other spells such as Blessing of Freedom, Blessing of Sacrifice, and Righteous Defense. 

#showtooltip Blessing of Protection 
/cast [target=mouseover,help] Blessing of Protection; Blessing of Protection

Twist start attack macro. This macro is used for ensuring a twist right when engaging a target. While having a seal up, walk up to a target with your auto attack off. When in melee range you use this macro, applying your other seal, using Avenging Wrath, any trinkets, and beginning your auto attack. This gives you a good chance of both seals proccing on the beginning of your attack. 

#showtooltip Seal of Blood
/cast Avenging Wrath
/use *trinket name*
/cast Seal of Blood
/startattack 

You can also make one of these macros with no AW or trinket.

#showtooltip Seal of Blood
/cast Seal of Blood
/startattack

Judgement + Seal macro. This macro is used to reapply your seal right after you judge, it can be swapped out with any seal. Personally I do not use this macro, as sometimes the judgement is used during a gcd, which means that you cannot apply the seal during that time. 

#show Judgement
/cast Judgement
/cast Seal of Command(Rank 1)

Stopattack judgement macro This macro is used to apply your SotC before and prepare for a twist. You must be out of melee range or you will still trigger the attack.

#showtooltip Judgement
/startattack
/cast Judgement
/cast Seal of Command(Rank 1)
/stopattack


Cancelaura bubble macro. Useful macro used for cancelling any paladin bubble quickly. 

/cancelaura Divine Shield
/cancelaura Blessing of Protection
